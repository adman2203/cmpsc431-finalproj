# cmpsc431-finalproj
Final Project for CMPSC431W at Penn State.
We made a gym management system as part of our database management class.

Requires MySQL. Installation and usage instructions will be posted eventually
I am using VSCode for the project so I am using the SQLTools extension for the local database, and mysql.connector to make the python code work with sql.

To install mysql connector you can run:
pip install mysql-connector-python
